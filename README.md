## Description
Our project is about evaluation of different channel allocation schemes in wireless networks.

We are mainly studying three different channel allocation schemes :

1. Distributed Scheme
2. Centralized Scheme
3. Hybrid Scheme

We will be designing each of the schemes, and study the performance of the system with each scheme and provide with an optimized solution.
